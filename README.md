## kaggle-titanic
##### I began learning machine learning about a couple years ago, and my first project involved working with the Titanic dataset on Kaggle. I attempted some feature engineering and experimented with different algorithms, which resulted in a score of 0.78. Moving forward, I plan to undertake more projects to continue honing my skills.

##### Do leave suggestions if you think there are some areas I can do better. Thanks~
